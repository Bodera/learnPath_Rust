# learnPath_Rust
Rust is a great programming language for software development, also is a robust alternative to C++

## Reason
I want to learn Rust because is a technology with resources that made software and systems development more safe, efficient, performatic and reliable. According to the web, it supports different programming paradigms such as: object-oriented, structured, imperative compiled, concurrent and functional. Also I confess that I'm afraid to learn C derivative languages. But I swear that [Lua](https://www.lua.org) will come up in some repository soon (and C derivative languages too, yeah!).

## It is only this?
The branch `master` is updated weekly, the branch `Bodera-rust-dev` is updated every 2-4 days instead.

#### Where do I find `Bodera-rust-dev`?
You can easily go to the `dev` branch by clicking [aqu√≠](https://github.com/Bodera/learnPath_Rust/tree/Bodera-rust-dev).

## Environment details
My terminal produces the following output when I run the `lsb_release -a` command.

## How do I write a good README?
Without practice there is no success. Access [here](https://github.com/Bodera/goodPractices_Github), a repository of good practices in GitHub, there are available orientations and hyperlinks references about how to contribute with the community.
